For this project we have decided that we want to build a Rubiks cube solver that uses ML to recognize the cubes color and patterns. Then will create a 3D model of the scanned cube, and follow to solve it step-by-step using a certain algorithm. It will focus on Ai recognizing and optimizing color recognition. This is a Binary classifcation since the cube is either solved or unsolved. 

The data will conists of images of rubiks cubes.

For the Experiment design we will first start by dealing how the program gets the cube. For simplicity we have agreed that instead of taking pictures of the cube, we will have a folder of the 6 sides of the cube, process the pictures to make a 3D model that can be moved around by the solving algorithm we will use. Then have a simulation of the cube being solved where anyone can follow along to solve their cube.
